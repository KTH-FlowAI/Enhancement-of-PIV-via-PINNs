# Enhancement of PIV measurements via physics-informed neural networks

This repository features codes and data employed for developing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for enhancing boundary layer PIV measurements by reconstructing the mean velocity field and correcting the measurement errors in the data. Within this framework, the PINNs-based model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes equations for turbulent boundary layers without a prior assumption and by only taking the data at the domain boundaries. More details about the implementation and the results are available in [Hasanuzzaman G, Eivazi H, Merbold S, Egbers C, Vinuesa R., 2023.
